                                    Implementing a new technology like robotics on the factory floor is a
                                    big undertaking involving steps such as identifying opportunities, exploring
                                    technology offerings, connecting with vendors and service providers, collecting
                                    proposals, evaluating return on investment, selection, and more. And that is all
                                    prior to implementation. With so many responsibilities to keep a successful
                                    operation running, manufacturers often run short on bandwidth to thoroughly evaluate
                                    technology. As a result, Catalyst Connection rolled out their Systems Integrator
                                    Selection Assistance offering to come alongside the manufacturer and support them
                                    through the whole process. Catalyst’s connection to the nationwide MEP Network and
                                    Manufacturing USA Institutes like ARM (Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing) further
                                    increases the level of support and expertise available.

                                    it placed on manufacturers pushed this to a whole new level. Many manufacturers saw
                                    the associated slowdown as an opportunity to explore and implement new technologies.
                                    Catalyst Connection expanded their Systems Integrator Selection Assistance service

                                Technician Apprenticeship helps entry-level workers in manufacturing quickly enhance their
                                skills and advance with their current employer. Due to changing manufacturing technologies,
                                entry-level workers require higher skills than before and employers are struggling to recruit
                                and retain these type of workers. The IMT program is a state registered apprenticeship to help
                                meet these employer needs.</p>
                            <p class="slider__text mt-3"> This registered apprenticeship program is a hybrid approach providing
                                production workers with the knowledge and competencies needed in the advanced manufacturing
                                environment. A hybrid approach integrates time-based learning combined with competency-based
                                training. Registered apprenticeships utilize an “Earn and Learn” approach to building worker
                                skills. The IMT program provides 3,000 hours of structured technical instruction. This
                                instruction is comprised of 2,736 hours of on-the-job training (OJT) from experienced mentors
                                assigned by the employer and 264 hours of related technical instruction. All IMT apprentices are
                                employees of a specific company, earning wages, benefits, and seniority while they learn new
                                skills.</p>

                                The Explore the New Manufacturing website provides information about careers in manufacturing for students, parents, and teachers.  The youthfully themed website was relaunched in January 2021.  Students can find videos and other information about careers in manufacturing.  Teachers will see resources for their classrooms including experiential learning programs, lesson plans, and virtual experiences.  Parents can learn about how manufacturing has changed and what resources are available for their young ones to pursue these careers.  Additional resources, events, and career guidance are provided through the blog.

Projects involve emergingtechnologies and increasing the regional awareness of the program successes through videos and new promotional materials.

                                    MIC projects begin with students and teacher taking a tour of the partnering company and learning about the problem to be solved; then working on their projects in the classroom for 8-10 weeks, and finally, presenting their recommendations/solutions to the company representatives. Past projects have included new product development, market research, technology solutions, quality improvement, and process improvements. This program exposes students to career opportunities in manufacturing, provides them with skill enhancement opportunities through solving real-world problems, and provides teachers with a way to bring manufacturing into their curriculum. Catalyst has also utilized virtual projects during the time frame when Covid-19 restrictions at schools make it impossible to do in-person activities.

                                    The What’s So Cool About Manufacturing middle school video contest (WSCAM) initiative engages students in exploring the new manufacturing and additional exposure of manufacturing careers to thousands throughout the SWPA region.

                                    Teacher advisors receive training on video production, storytelling, career connections, and best practices from other participating teachers. Schools are matched up with local manufacturing companies to produce a short video from the student’s point of view on why manufacturing is so cool.

                                    Catalyst Connection’s Industrial Manufacturing Technician (IMT) pre-apprenticeship program is a key bridge between those on a pathway to manufacturing to careers.  Our program has been approved as Pennsylvania certified program and has been gaining momentum in the region.  This is due in part to schools needing to pivot to virtual or hybrid learning models during the Covid-19 pandemic.  But also, there is a strong desire for schools to provide content that is industry relevant, industry approved, and that leads to industry recognized credentials.  Our program provides all of these attributes while leveraging content and experiences from our other programs/resources.  The program was piloted in 2019-20 academic year with 3 students at Quaker Valley High School.  Since the initial pilot period, Quaker Valley has expanded to 24 students and integrated into the curriculum of their engineering class.  Nazareth Prep and Intermediate Unit 1’s 3 campus schools are also adopting the program.  We have interest from four other schools.  We are projecting to have over 100 students involved in the program in 2021 with strong interest continuing into the future.  We will expand the program to include 6 additional schools and support 100 total students on beginning this pathway to a career in manufacturing.  Students enrolled in the pre-apprenticeship program will take two online modules from our IMT apprenticeship curriculum.  Tours of local companies, speakers in the classroom, job shadowing, interviewing skills, and resume writing will also be provided.  We will also leverage our various Explore the New Manufacturing career resources including flyers, mobile games, virtual scavenger hunts, and websites.  Those without IMT registered companies in close proximity to their school still have the opportunity to enroll in other regional apprenticeship programs (Catalyst’s robotics technician apprenticeship, NTMA, German Chamber, etc.) or go directly into the workforce as they will have a demonstrated aptitude for the skills required upon completing the pre-apprenticeship experience.  Our workforce team will assist in the placement of students upon completion of the pre-apprenticeship in jobs or local training programs.
